   <title id="title_a35">Configuring LDAP Integration for User Authentication</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>LDAP only manages authentication into the system, not authorizations. Users who are
      authorized to access AP Analyzer will need to be added as an "Analyzer User" before they can
      authenticate through LDAP.</p>
      <p>
         <note>The Analyzer application will either be fully native, fully LDAP, or fully AD/LDAP; no
        mixed or hybrid mode is allowed. If LDAP authentication is in use and some users in the
        Analyzer database do not currently exist in LDAP, you cannot log in with those users, nor
        edit them. Note that the user list provides no indication LDAP versus native users.</note>
      </p>
      <p>At installation time, you must select "LDAP" mode in the Deployment Manager console and fill
      in the LDAP fields.</p>
