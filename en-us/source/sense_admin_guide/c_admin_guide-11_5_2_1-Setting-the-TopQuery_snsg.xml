   <title>Setting the TopQueryFastExit Flag</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Above and beyond the performance improvement gained by running a <codeph>TOP</codeph> query without sorting
      the data, you may also be able to improve query performance by enabling the "EDW top query
      fast exist" field in the Advanced EDW section of the SenSage AP Service Configs tab of
      Deployment Manager.</p>
      <p>Although the EDW Query Engine automatically stops processing an unordered <codeph>TOP</codeph> query as soon
      as it retrieves the number of rows specified in the <codeph>TOP</codeph> clause; enabling the <codeph>TopQueryFastExit</codeph>
      may further improve performance.</p>
      <p>Set <codeph>TopQueryFastExit</codeph> to 1 to cause an unordered <codeph>TOP</codeph> query to stop processing as soon as the
      EDW retrieves the number of rows specified in the <codeph>TOP</codeph> clause. You must set this field in the
      <filepath>athttpd.conf</filepath> file on every node in the cluster and restart the EDW for the change to take
      effect.</p>
      <p>By default the flag is set to 0 and the feature is not enabled.</p>
      <note>Although the EDW log file contains broken pipe error messages when you enable
      <codeph>TopQueryFastExit</codeph>, these messages indicate no actual problem. The only issue is that they
      clutter the log file. If running the query without enabling this flag performs sufficiently,
      there is no need to enable this flag as well.</note>
