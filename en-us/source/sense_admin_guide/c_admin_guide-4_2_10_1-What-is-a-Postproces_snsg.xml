   <title>What is a Postprocessor?</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>A postprocessor:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>is a set of functions in Perl.</li>
         <li>accepts input row/column data returned from the EDW in response to a query.</li>
         <li>accepts input data that conforms to an "incoming schema" (that is, a set of column names
        and SQL data types).</li>
         <li>generates output row/column data, which is the data eventually displayed by the
          <codeph>atquery</codeph> program.</li>
         <li>generates that output data that conforms to an "outgoing schema," which may or may not be
        the same as the "incoming schema."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A postprocessor is typically used for the two following scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>To slightly modify one or more column values before return to the client application
          <p>The postprocessor takes incoming rows, makes a slight change to each row, and passes on
          the values as output rows</p>
         </li>
         <li>To do specialized aggregation or data formatting<p>The postprocessor takes incoming rows
          and generates outgoing rows that do not directly correspond one-for-one to input
        rows.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Postprocessors do not chain or cascade. You cannot feed the output of one postprocessor as
      input to a second postprocessor.</p>
