   <title>Turning .sql Files into Unix Shell Scripts</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>For Unix users who would like their SQL files to be runnable, <codeph>atquery</codeph> knows
      to ignore the first line of SQL files that start with "<codeph>#!</codeph>". To support this
      capability, you must create a wrapper shell script like the
      following:<codeblock xml:space="preserve">#!/bin/sh
# this will launch the real atquery program with the given .sql file
# note: please adjust INSTALLNAME, HOST and PORT to reflect your installation
/home/lms/INSTALLNAME/atquery HOST:PORT $*</codeblock>
      </p>
      <p>Then, start runnable <filepath>.sql</filepath> files like the
         following:<codeblock xml:space="preserve">#!/usr/local/bin/runatquery
select count(*) from mytable during all</codeblock></p>
      <note>You must <codeph>chmod</codeph> both shell scripts, so they become executable; for
      example, <codeph>chmod 755</codeph>
         <codeph>runatquery</codeph>. Also, many shells have a limit on the length of the
        <codeph>#!</codeph> line; often, it's limited to 32 characters, and fails silently.</note>
