   <title>Checking Locking Status and IPC State Information</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Run the showlocks command to display a list of all ACTIVE and PENDING locks plus additional
      IPC-related state information associated with the indicated data store.</p>
      <p>
         <codeblock xml:space="preserve">showlocks { --delete-ipc-data } [dsroot]</codeblock>
      </p>
      <p>Use the <codeph>--delete-ipc-data</codeph> switch only if it is determined that a process has
      crashed and left the IPC-state information in a corrupted state. This switch is meant for use
      as a last-resort solution.</p>
