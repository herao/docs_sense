      <p>If an EDW node in your SenSage AP instance fails, you can restore functionality using the
      procedures in this section. When one of the EDW nodes fails, you can configure your SenSage AP
      instance to operate in a degraded mode, without the failed EDW node this mode of
      operation, you can continue to load data into the EDW and run queries against the data, but
      you cannot perform meta-data operations such as adding, or dropping tables or views.</p>
      <p>After configuring this limited mode, you can then restore the failed EDW node to restore the
      SenSage AP instance to full functionality. Alternately, if an EDW node fails, you can stop
      operations on the entire SenSage AP instance and then restore or replace the failed EDW node.
      Because each EDW node has a duplicate copy of its data store located on another node, no data
      is lost.</p>
