   <title>Using Active Directory with LDAP</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The Active Directory authority authenticates each user's name and password at login. After
      you configure Active Directory integration, SenSage AP Analyzer logs into the Active Directory
      server for enumeration of groups and users using on-demand and scheduled synchronization.</p>
      <p>This solution provides the following advantages:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>allows enterprise administrators to manage users, groups, and passwords using a familiar
         mechanism that already provides these services for other systems and applications.</li>
         <li>delegates authentication from AP Analyzer to an external authority system (such as
         AD/LDAP)</li>
         <li>facilitates logging</li>
         <li>facilitates the management of password rotation, enforces password complexity policies and
         recovery of users accounts from lockout.</li>
      </ul>
