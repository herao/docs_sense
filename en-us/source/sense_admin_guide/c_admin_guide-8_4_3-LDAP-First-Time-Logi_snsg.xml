   <title>LDAP First Time Login</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>After a fresh installation of SenSage AP Analyzer, no users in the database are guaranteed to
      be present in LDAP. When LDAP authentication is in use and the first user logs into the
      system, if that user is successfully authenticated against LDAP, the user will become a
      designated "Admin User" with the ability to create other users. The "Admin" User can designate
      LDAP user authentication one-time for all users using the procedure as noted in <xref href="c_admin_guide-8_4_1-Designating-LDAP-use_snsg.xml#topic_8_4_1"/>.</p>
