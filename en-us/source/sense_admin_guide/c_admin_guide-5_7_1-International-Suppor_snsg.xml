   <title>International Support in the EDW</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The EDW supports the storage of<i> international characters</i>, which are characters other
      than those in the U.S. English alphabet and some of its punctuation marks. For example, the
      Spanish word</p>
      <p>“España” contains the international character “ñ”. The EDW stores all text values with UTF-8
      character encoding to ensure that international characters are stored and queried
      successfully.</p>
      <p>For more details on character sets, encoding schemes, and using computer fonts with encoding
      schemes, see. “SenSageUsing the SenSage Event Data Warehouse (EDW)” in the <cite>Event Data
        Warehouse Guide</cite>.</p>
