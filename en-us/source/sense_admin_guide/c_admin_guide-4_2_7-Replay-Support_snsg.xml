   <title>Replay Support</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>When diagnosing performance issues, it is often helpful to save the output from the EDW
      particular, <codeph>atquery</codeph> supports a command (replay) that lets you simulate
      re-running the query that was previously run.</p>
      <p>To save the exact bytes sent over the network from the EDW host, run atquery
        <codeph>--raw</codeph> and save the results to a file. To replay the results, run
        <codeph>atquery replay <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>
         </codeph>. Specifying "-" (dash) instead of the
      filename causes the replay to get data from standard input.</p>
      <p>The following example connects the live query to
      replay:<codeblock xml:space="preserve"># runs myfile.sql and saves the raw XML messages to savefile.rwt
# and simultaneously visualizes them using "replay"
atquery host:port myfile.sql --raw | tee savefile.rwt | atquery replay -
# replay them (doesn't re-run the query)
atquery replay savefile.rwt</codeblock>
      </p>
      <note>You will need to <codeph>grep</codeph> out the "delay" lines to clean up the
      output.</note>
