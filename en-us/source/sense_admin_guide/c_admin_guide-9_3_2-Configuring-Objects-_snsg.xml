   <title>Configuring Objects in Active Directory</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Active Directory arranges objects in a hierarchy that comprises Domains, OUs (organizational
      units), groups, and users. The Active Directory framework also includes higher-level
      collections of objects called forests and trees. For integration with SenSage AP, only
      domains, OUs, and groups are relevant.</p>
