   <title>About the Event Data Warehouse</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The Event Data Warehouse (EDW) is a database built for and dedicated to loading, storing, and
      analyzing log data. The software uses sophisticated, application-level clustering to perform
      all load and query tasks fully in parallel across an arbitrary number of hosts. This
      architecture allows users to load and query massive data volumes in a single, logical database
      instance without partitioning. The EDW uses a proprietary data model that achieves high levels
      of compression, while still making all data fully available to query.</p>
