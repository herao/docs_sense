   <title>Adding a New Host</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>To add a new host:</p>
      <ol id="ol_ykc_3qh_vx">
         <li>Click the Hosts tab to go the Hosts screen:</li>
         <li>Click the Add New Hosts button.</li>
         <li>The Add New Hosts screen is displayed as shown in Figure 2-28.</li>
         <li>Complete the screen by adding the names of the hosts that you want to add by supplying the
        FQDN of each host.</li>
         <li>To allow the Deployment Manager GUI to access the SSH Private Key that you set up (so it
        can securely access all the hosts in the system), provide the key that is in the file
          <filepath>~/.ssh/id_dsa</filepath> on the Deployment server for the root user. Copy and
        paste the key in the field provided, or click <uicontrol>Choose File</uicontrol> if you want
        the GUI to open the file and get the contents for you.<p>
               <note>If you are using IE 9, the Choose File button may not appear. Use the text box to
            cut and paste your private key manually.</note>
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Click <uicontrol>Register and Confirm</uicontrol>.</li>
         <li>Follow instructions beginning with the <i>Confirm Hosts</i> section of the
