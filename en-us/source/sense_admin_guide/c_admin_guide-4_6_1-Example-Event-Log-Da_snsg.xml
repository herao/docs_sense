   <title>Example Event-Log Data</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Your SenSage AP solution includes example log events from a variety of log-source types. The
      examples include the source log events, corresponding PTL files for loading the events into
      the EDW, and corresponding <filepath>.sql</filepath> files with queries that can be run
      against the loaded events. The event data comes from real production systems; to protect
      privacy, some values have been substituted in a 1-for-1 mapping to preserve statistical
      relevance.</p>

         <note>SenSage AP compression technology works more efficiently than gzip for very large
        volumes of data. Due to file-system overhead, benefits are not seen generally below about
        10- 50MB of log data.</note>
