   <title id="title_a26">Preparing Log Data for Loading</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The Collector does not rotate logs. Therefore, you need to provide your own means for
      rotating logs on your log hosts in a way that is compatible with the Collector.
      Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>provide a log file that is not actively being written to</li>
         <li>ensure that the logs maintain unique names</li>
         <li>include an archive sub-directory for SFTP, FTP, and HTTP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Collector package includes a script called <filepath>log-rotate.exe</filepath> (for
      Windows) or<filepath> log-rotate</filepath> (for Linux) that provides an example of how you
      can write a script to achieve this task. Run the script with no options to see its usage.</p>
      <p>To use the script, you must specify:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>a sourceFile</li>
         <li>a targetDir</li>
         <li>whether you want hourly or daily naming</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The script creates an <filepath>archive/</filepath> directory (under the targetDir), then compresses and renames
      the files.</p>
      <p>The script also has an option that enables you to specify a hierarchy of directories for
      archived sub-directories. Because the Collector typically does not use this option, you should
      turn it off.</p>
