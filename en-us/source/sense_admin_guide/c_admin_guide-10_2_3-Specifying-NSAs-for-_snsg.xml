   <title>Specifying NSAs for Remote File Systems</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>When you specify the NSA for a remote file system, precede the network storage address
      with:</p>
      <p>
         <codeph>directory://</codeph>
      </p>
      <p>The complete NSA syntax for a remote file system is:</p>
      <p>
         <codeph>directory://&lt;<i>
               <b>local-NFS-mount-point</b>
            </i>
            <i>&gt;</i>
         </codeph>
      </p>
      <p>Substitute &lt;<i>local-NFS-mount-point</i>&gt; with the local mount point that you will use on
      all hosts in the EDW instance.</p>
      <p>
         <b>Example</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         <codeph>directory:///nss</codeph>
      </p>
      <p>Generally, you set up one remote host as the Nearline target for all EDW hosts when you use
      remote file systems for Nearline storage.</p>
      <note>Before you mount your NFS mountpoint as a hard or soft mount, consider the following:<ul>
            <li>
               <b>hard mount</b>—If the connection to the remote file system breaks, the NFS server hangs
          indefinitely while it waits for the IO request to complete. When the NFS server hangs, the
          archive process also hangs while it waits for the remote file system to return online.
          This situation does not cause other operations to hang but it prevents the archive
          operation from completing and logging an error.</li>
            <li>
               <b>soft mount</b>—If the connection to the remote file system fails, the NFS server fails
          all IO requests, which causes the EDW to fail the archive operation.</li>
         </ul>
      </note>
