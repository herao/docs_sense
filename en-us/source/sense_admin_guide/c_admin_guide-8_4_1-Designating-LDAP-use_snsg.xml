   <title>Designating LDAP user authentication one-time (for all users)</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>To designate LDAP user authentication one-time for all users, your enterprise must have
      Active Directory (AD), a Windows-based authentication authority that manages users and groups.
      If both AD and the SenSage AP cluster is installed and operational, to authenticate all users
      at once, see <xref href="c_admin_guide-9-ConfiguringActiveD_snsg.xml#topic_9"/>.</p>
