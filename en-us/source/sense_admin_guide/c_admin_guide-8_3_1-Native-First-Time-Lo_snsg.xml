   <title>Native First Time Login</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>After a fresh installation of SenSage AP Analyzer, no users in the database are guaranteed to
      be present. When native authentication is in use and the first user logs into the system, if
      that user is successfully authenticated in AP Analyzer, the user will become a designated
      "Admin" user with the ability to create other users.</p>
