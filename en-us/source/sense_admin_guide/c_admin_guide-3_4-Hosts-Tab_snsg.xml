   <conbody>
      <p>Click the Hosts tab to view the status of components in your cluster on a host-by-host basis.
      Note that the Host screen is displayed depicting either a single host or a multi-host
      environment. The screenshot below illustrates a multi-host environment.</p>

      <p>On the Host screen the top row displays the number of hosts in the cluster, indicating
      whether the hosts are healthy, what masters/slaves, if any, are down, if no heartbeat was
      detected, and if any of the hosts have an alert (meaning that one or more components are not
      in service.)</p>
      <p>Beneath the Components drop-down button, you can mouse over an applicable row that represents
      the components of the host that you want to display. This is shown in the screenshot
      below.</p>
      <p>When you click the components drop-down button itself, you will see a list of all possible
      master and slave components in the deployment as shown in the screenshot below. You can place
      a check beside the component to which you want to add to a specific host and click
        <uicontrol>Apply</uicontrol>.</p>
