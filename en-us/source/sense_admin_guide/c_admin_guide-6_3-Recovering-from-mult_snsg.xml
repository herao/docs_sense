   <title>Recovering from multiple failed EDW Nodes</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The procedure for recovering from multiple failed EDW nodes is exactly the same as
    replacing a single node; the only exception is that you can expect data loss when you are
    recovering multiple failed nodes that constitute the primary and secondary data stores of
    EDW.</p>
