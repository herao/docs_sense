            <pd>To avoid modifying terabytes of data during upgrades, the EDW only upgrades the file format
       of its data files as new data is loaded. Over multiple upgrades, this can result in a data
       store with many versions of the files some rare cases, newer versions of the data store
       provide better performance or other features, and it is advantageous to manually upgrade
       production tables to the latest version.
       <note type="important"> Consult IgniteTech Support before using this command, because it can be very
         slow and results in the table being unreadable by older versions of the EDW.</note>
