   <title>Postgres and Log Data Security</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The SenSage EDW (Postgres) and the SenSage AP Analyzer authenticate and authorize data access
      by three discreet security features that control:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>SenSage AP features a user may perform</li>
         <li>SenSage AP Application objects a user may view and act on (that is, View, Edit, and Run
         permissions)</li>
         <li>SenSage AP owners of log data to ensure security and appropriate access of the data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that no separation exists between a defined Postgres user and role--the user and role is
      synonymous in the SenSage AP (Postgres) Security Model. The separation of security into the
      three separate areas noted above, allows, for example, an Analyzer Administrator not to have
      access to a specific user’s (role’s) log data.</p>
