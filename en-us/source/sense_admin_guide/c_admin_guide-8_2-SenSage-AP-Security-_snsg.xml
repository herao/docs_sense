   <title id="title_a33">SenSage AP Security Model and Postgres</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>SenSage AP security leverages Postgres’ powerful and complex security model. By creating
      Postgres users and granting them access to schemas(s) and table(s) required for user
      selection, you allow SenSage AP to secure access to log data schemas associated with specific
      AP functionality.</p>
      <p>Securing SenSage AP consists of the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Standard Web Application Security</li>
         <li>Resource Security</li>
         <li>Data Security</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <note>Postgres security provides in depth and robust security capabilities. The scope of this
        overview is limited only to the fundamentals required to achieve security through access to
        AP Event Data Warehouse (EDW) schemas, as managed through the SenSage AP Analyzer. For
        further details on Postgres’ vast capabilities, see the Postgres documentation. For
        specifics on Analyzer usage, see the <cite>SenSage AP Analyzer Guide</cite>.</note>
