   <conbody>
      <p>To authenticate and authorize users in SenSage AP, you can do one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Specify “native” users who are stored in Postgres for authentication and authorization.
         Note that this is the default when you install SenSage AP.</li>
         <li>Use LDAP (Light-weight Directory Access Protocol) for authentication which you have the
         option to select when you install SenSage AP. With LDAP authentication user names and
         passwords are stored in LDAP and users are authenticated against LDAP at login time.</li>
         <li>Use Active Directory (AD) to delegate SenSage AP Analyzer user authentication to AD. You
         use Analyzer to synchronize users and groups with the ones in AD. Those users and groups that
         are members of the AD domain specified in Analyzer are automatically mapped to SenSage AP.</li>
      </ul>
      <note>An Analyzer "admin" account is created in Analyzer during product installation. This
      account has the privilege to create a user account that matches the user name of an LDAP user
      and provides that user with appropriate group and role permissions.</note>
