   <title>How the Event Data Warehouse (EDW) Queues Tasks</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The EDW has three queues: one for Normal Priority processes, one for Critical Priority
      processes, and one for Urgent Priority processes. The first two of these queues are defined
      in:</p>
      <p>
         <filepath>/opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/etc/sls/instance/&lt;instance_name&gt;/athttpd.conf</filepath>
      </p>
      <p>as:</p>
      <ul id="ul_uwx_ds5_vx">
         <li>
            <codeph>normalrunqueuequota</codeph> (default <codeph>3</codeph>)</li>
         <li>
            <codeph>criticalrunqueuequota</codeph> (default <codeph>10</codeph>)</li>
      </ul>
      <note>These queues are set in the Deployment Managerâ€™s Advanced EDW section (under the HawEye
      AP service Configs tab) in the fields "EDW normal run queue quota" and "EDW critical run queue
      quota".</note>
      <p>The third process, <codeph>UrgentRunQueueQuota</codeph>, cannot be configured. This process
      has an infinite depth, which means it can run an infinite number of jobs. The EDW immediately
      runs everything on this queue)</p>
      <p>The command "<codeph>atmanage canceltask</codeph>" has urgent priority by default, all other
      tasks have normal priority. Therefore the <codeph>--skip-queues</codeph> option is not
      necessary for cancels to work on a loaded system.</p>
      <p>The Normal and Critical queues independently allow a set number of requests to run
      simultaneously. (This number can be changed for these queues, see <xref href="c_admin_guide-5_2-Backup-and-Restore_snsg.xml#topic_5_2"/>).</p>
      <p>If there are more requests of a given priority than can be run simultaneously, the later
      requests will be blocked until an earlier request completes. Blocked tasks are marked as
        <codeph>EVENT_WAIT</codeph> in the state column of the <codeph>system.task_list</codeph>
      table.</p>
