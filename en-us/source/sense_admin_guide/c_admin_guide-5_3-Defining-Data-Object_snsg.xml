   <conbody>
      <p>In addition to using the atquery utility to query the database, you can also use it to
      create, rename, and drop database tables, column filters, and views. You can either specify
      these actions in the <codeph>.sql</codeph> files that <codeph>atquery</codeph> processes or
      you can use the dash option to specify the data manipulation statement directly from the
      command line.</p>
      <p>You can use <codeph>atquery</codeph> to create and manipulate the following database objects
      in an EDW instance:<ul id="ul_ily_yz5_vx">
            <li>
               <b>Tables</b>—tabular objects that store loaded log events<p>or more information, see
            “Defining Tables with SenSage AP SQL (AP SQL)” in the <cite>Event Data Warehouse
              Guide</cite>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Column Filters</b>—special objects attached to table columns to improve query
          performance For more information, see “Defining Column Filters with SenSage AP SQL”\ of
          the <cite>Event Data Warehouse Guide</cite>.</li>
            <li>
               <b>Views</b>—tabular objects through which log events in tables can be viewed in
          different ways.<p>For more information, see “Defining Views with SenSage AP SQL” of the
              <cite>Event Data Warehouse Guide</cite>.</p>
