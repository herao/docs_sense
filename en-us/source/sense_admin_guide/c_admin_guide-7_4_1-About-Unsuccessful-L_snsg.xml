   <title>About Unsuccessful Loads</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Log data does not always load correctly into the EDW instance. Incorrectly loaded data can
      include loads that partially completed or loads that were aborted and reloaded. The EDW tracks
      every upload to the system, storing the unique identifier of each load in the
        <codeph>_uploadid</codeph> column of each table. Loads that fail upload are tagged as
      inconsistent. By default, the data in an inconsistent load does not display when you query the
      EDW.</p>
      <p>
         <note>A successful load does not necessarily insert every row from the source log file.
        Typically log files contain data that cannot be parsed and loaded; however, bad data does
        not prevent these files from loading successfully. A failed load is caused by a protocol
        error, such as not receiving all the expected data or a load cancellation.</note>
