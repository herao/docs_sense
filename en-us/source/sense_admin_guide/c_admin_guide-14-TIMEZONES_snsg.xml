   <title>Time Zones</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>This appendix lists every time zone supported by the EDW and the SenSage AP Analyzer. When
      you enter a time value in SenSage AP Analyzer, use one of the time-zone formats listed below
      in <xref href="c_admin_guide-14_2-Supported-Time-Zones_snsg.xml#topic_14_2"/>.</p>
      <p>Because the EDW handles raw data from logs, which does not always use the supported time
      zones, it must accommodate some shortenings of time zone indicators found in that data (such
      as PDT for Pacific Daylight Time and CST for Central Standard Time). For more information, see
        <xref href="c_admin_guide-14_1-Time-Zone-Conversion_snsg.xml#topic_14_1"/>, next.</p>
