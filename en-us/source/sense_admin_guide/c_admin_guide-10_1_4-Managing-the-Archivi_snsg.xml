   <title>Managing the Archiving to Nearline Storage</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>You can manage the archiving of local data in an EDW instance manually or on a scheduled
      basis. SenSage AP provides a command-line utility for manually archiving local data on
      demand.</p>
      <p>Before people can manage archiving to Nearline storage, a system administrator performs some
      initial configuration tasks. Thereafter, other people can manage archiving manually or on a
      schedule.</p>
      <p>For more information on the command-line utility, see <xref href="c_admin_guide-10_3-Archiving-of-Local-D_snsg.xml#topic_10_3"/>.</p>
