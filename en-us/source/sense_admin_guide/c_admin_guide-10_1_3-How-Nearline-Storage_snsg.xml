   <title>How Nearline Storage Works</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The figure below illustrates the states of a SenSage AP Nearline-storage archive process.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <b>Step 1: Initial State</b>—The data store for the EDW instance resides on the local
    hosts, such as the three hosts shown in the figure  below.</li>
         <li>
            <b>Step 2: Archive Process</b>—An outside agent (a person or automated process) schedules
        archiving of EDW data onto the Nearline storage device.</li>
         <li>
            <b>Step 3: Archive Complete</b>—After archiving completes, a BLOB (binary large object)
        that contains the user's data and other associated data is created on the NLS device. A
        reference ID to the blob is created in each data store of the EDW instance.</li>
         <li>
            <b>Step 4: Active</b>—When a query that requires access to the archived data on the
        Nearline storage device is invoked on the EDW, the EDW uses the reference IDs to locate the
        data for retrieval.</li>
      </ul>
