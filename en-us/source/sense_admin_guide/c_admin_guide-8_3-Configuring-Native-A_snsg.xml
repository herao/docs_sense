   <conbody>
      <p>In <i>Native</i> authentication users are created and managed solely in the Analyzer database
      in which passwords are stored and encrypted. All information for authorizing access to
      functionality or data in the application is stored in the Analyzer database. The default
      "Native" mode is selected in the Deployment Manager console at the time of installation; you
      can ignore all LDAP/AD fields, which will be displayed as read-only when native mode is
      select.</p>
