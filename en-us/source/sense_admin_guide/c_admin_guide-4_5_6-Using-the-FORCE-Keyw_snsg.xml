   <title>Using the FORCE Keyword</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The FORCE keyword causes the RETIRE command to remove corrupted data. If you run RETIRE
      without this keyword and the EDW detects any corruption in the data to be retired, it removes
      only the non-corrupted data specified by the command and returns an error about the corrupted
      data.</p>
      <p>Hexis Cyber Solutions recommends that you run RETIRE without the FORCE keyword when you first
      retire old or bad data. Running without forcing the retirement allows the EDW to inform you of
      corrupted data and provides the opportunity for you to examine that data. After you have taken
      the necessary steps to prevent similar corruption in the future, run RETIRE with the FORCE
      keyword to remove the corrupted data.</p>
