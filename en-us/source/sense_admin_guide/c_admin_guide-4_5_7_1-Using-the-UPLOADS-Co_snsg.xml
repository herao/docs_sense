   <title>Using the UPLOADS Command</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>To permanently delete the records associated with a given set of upload IDs, provide a comma-
      separated list of upload IDs. The syntax is:</p>
      <p>
         <codeph>UPLOADS &lt;upload_id&gt; [, &lt;upload_id&gt;[...]][DURING &lt;timestamp&gt;,
        &lt;timestamp&gt;]</codeph>
      </p>
      <p>where the DURING causes the RETIRE command to delete only the data in the specified time and
      date range. You can choose the optional DURING clause when deleting an upload ID that
      encompasses a very wide time and date range. Using the DURING clause can help avoid possible
      negative impacts on performance by breaking the deletion job into a series of smaller
      operations addressing shorter time ranges within the larger min and max timestamp of the
      load.</p>
      <p>Example:<codeblock xml:space="preserve">atquery localhost:8072 -e RETIRE FROM syslog 
 UPLOADS ’31AEAF94551AA4366519F4)EB3F9A4FA’, ’F8OC8F2003D655A8444A8B4EF172EC7a’</codeblock>
    </p>
      <p>Example With DURING
      clause:<codeblock xml:space="preserve">atquery localhost: 8072 -e "RETIRE FROM syslog
 UPLOADS ’31AEAF94551AA4366519F4)EB3F9A4FA’, ’F8OC8F2003D655A8444A8B4EF172EC7a’ 
 DURING time(’FEB 01 00:00:00 2011’), time(’May 31 23:60:00 2011’)"
 OR DURING time (’Mar 01 00:00:00 2011’), time (’May 31 23:60:00 2011’)</codeblock>
    </p>
      <p>Example With FORCE
      Keyword:<codeblock xml:space="preserve">atquery localhost:8072 -e "RETIRE FROM syslog
 UPLOADS '31AEAF94551AA4366519F40EB3F9A4FA', 'F80C8F2003D655A8444A8B4EF172EC7A'
