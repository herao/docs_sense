   <title>Configuring a Centera Unit for Single-Instance Storage</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The Centera provides multiple ways to generate unique IDs (references) that identify the
      event-log data archived to it. For optimal storage capacity, IgniteTech recommends that you
      configure your Centera unit for single-instance storage; EDW saves two copies of all event-log
      data (primary and secondary), using single-instance storage cuts data storage in half.</p>
      <note>Configuring your SenSage AP installation such that multiple inserts to the same table occur
      at the same time reduces the benefit of single-instance storage for data loaded simultaneously
      to the same table.</note>
