   <title>NearLine Storage: Considerations</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>When adding empty columns to a table archived in NearLine Storage, consider the
      following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Empty columns you add are stored locally, regardless of where the original leaf node is
         archived. Because columns are empty, their footprint on disk is not large.</li>
         <li>Columns added using the INPUT or OUTPUT tags, the new, populated columns, are stored
         locally. They cannot be archived because the leaf node is already archived.</li>
         <li>If you delete columns, the <codeph>altertbl</codeph> command still retains those columns
        in NearLine storage, although the data store no longer references the columns. You wonâ€™t be
        able to query the data, but it is stored in that location until the leaf node is
        retired.</li>
      </ul>
