   <title>Loading Information about the Log File</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The atload utility allows you to store information about the log files from which rows were
      loaded in a column of the data. Use the $_log_filename and $log_srchost expression macros in
      your PTL SELECT statements. The atloadcommand declares the expression macros
      automatically.</p>
      <p>For example, you have log entries from multiple log sources in a large file named:</p>
      <codeblock xml:space="preserve">snmp-2002-01-09_04:00:00.gz</codeblock>
      <p>The filename carries the timestamp when the log file was createdâ€”its so-called roll time. The
      log file is being loaded from a host named h03. The following PTL SELECT statement uses
      $_log_filename and $log_srchost to store the roll time and host name as column values in the
      row being loaded.</p>
      <codeblock xml:space="preserve">SELECT _strptime(_strmatch($_log_filename, "(\d+-\d+-\d+_\d+:\d+:\d+)\.gz$"),
"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S") AS _rolltime, $_log_srchost AS _srchost FROM stdin;</codeblock>
      <note>Follow the convention of using an underscore (_) to begin the names of columns with
        metadata about the log entry to distinguish them from columns with data parsed from the log
        entry itself.</note>
