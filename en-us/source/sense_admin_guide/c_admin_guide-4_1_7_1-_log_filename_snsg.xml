   <title>$_log_filename</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The automatic expression macro $_log_filename carries the filename of the log file currently
      being loaded. Files in Collector log queues often carry useful information in their filenames.
      You should parse and store this information as column values in the row being loaded. For
      example, you should store the entire filename and parse other useful information from it, such
      as the time the log file was created.</p>
