   <title>Security Object Relationships</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The following items provide a summary of the security object relationships in the SenSage AP
      Security Model:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>When each SenSage AP user is defined, roles and groups are associated with each user. A
         userâ€™s roles are the union of all their direct roles.</li>
         <li>A Resource Instance such as a report, schedule, etc., is defined with an action(s) that a
         user and/or a group may perform on the instance.</li>
         <li>Roles have a list of privileges.</li>
         <li>Privileges control what actions a user may perform.</li>
         <li>Users and groups control what objects a user may view and what actions users and groups can
         perform on that object.</li>
      </ul>
   </conbody>
