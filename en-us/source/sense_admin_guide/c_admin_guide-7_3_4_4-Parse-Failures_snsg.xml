   <title>Parse Failures</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Parse failures mean that there is a problem in the PTL file. These failures may also occur if
      the log format changes, or if log files become corrupt.</p>
      <p>Also see the ParseFailure setting described in <i>Defining Loaders</i> in “SenSage AP
      Collector Configuration” of the <cite>Collector Guide</cite>. You can have multiple Loaders
      mapped to the same parse failure location.</p>
