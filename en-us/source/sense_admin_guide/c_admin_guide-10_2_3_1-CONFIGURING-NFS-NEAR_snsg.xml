   <title>CONFIGURING NFS NEARLINE STORAGE FOR SENSAGE AP SYSTEM USERS WITH DIFFERENT IDS</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The SenSage AP system user is known on remote file systems by the numeric user ID, not by the
   alphanumeric user name. This can cause a problem for Nearline storage if the numeric user IDs for
   the SenSage AP system user are different on different EDW hosts. In this situation, you must
   create a different NFS share for each of the user IDs assigned to the SenSage AP system user on
   the EDW hosts.</p>
      <p>For example, assume you have a 3-host EDW instance. The SenSage AP system user has
    "<codeph>4321</codeph>" as the user ID on two of the hosts; the user ID is
    "<codeph>5432</codeph>" on the other host.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>All three hosts use the same local mount point, "<codeph>/nss</codeph>". The two hosts where
   the user ID is "<codeph>4321</codeph>" mount the share "<codeph>Host-A:/nss</codeph>"; the other
   host where the user ID is "<codeph>5432</codeph>" mounts the share
   "<codeph>Host-B:/nss</codeph>". Alternate shares do not need to be on separate hosts; you can
   export and share different directories from the same remote host.</p>
      <p>As an alternative, you can change the user IDs for the SenSage AP system user to be the same on
   all EDW hosts.</p>
