   <title>$_log_srchost</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The automatic expression macro $_log_srchost carries the name of the machine from which the
      log file is being loaded. You should capture this information and store it as a column value
      in the row being loaded. This helps maintain the chain of custody for the log entry.</p>
