   <title>Viewing Data from Unsuccessful Loads</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Each row in EDW tables tracks the ID of the upload operation inserted the row. Rows inserted
      by an unsuccessful load are excluded from queries by default.</p>
      <p>If you want to view all data in a table, including data from unsuccessful loads or data
      currently being loaded, you must specify the <codeph>{INCLUDE_BAD_UPLOADS}</codeph> modifier
      on the table in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> clause. Include the curly braces as part of the
      modifier.</p>
      <p>
         <note>If a query and a load occur simultaneously and the query continues after the load
        completes, you may see all, none, or part of the data from the new load.</note>
      </p>
