   <title>User Authentication Modes</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The SenSage AP Analyzer has three modes of authentication:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <i>Native</i> authentication in which users are created and managed solely in the
        Analyzer database. Passwords are stored and encrypted in the database.</li>
         <li>
            <i>LDAP</i> authentication in which usernames and passwords are stored in LDAP and users
        are authenticated against LDAP at login time.</li>
         <li>
            <i>LDAP/AD</i> authentication in which usernames and passwords are stored in AD/LDAP and
        SenSage AP Analyzer delegates user authentication to AD at login time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Analyzerâ€™s authentication mode is configured during SenSage AP installation through
      user- selection in the Deployment Manager installation wizard. A property 'auth.method'
      present in the <codeph>/opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/analyzer/config/app.install.properties</codeph>
      file controls which authentication method is used. If the file contains
        <b>auth.method=ldap</b>, then other properties are read to determine the LDAP or AD/LDAP
      server location, credentials and search pattern to use.</p>
      <p>If set to any of the three modes (native, LDAP, or AD/LDAP), a default Analyzer "Admin"
      account will be created during installation. After the initial Analyzer "Admin" has logged in,
      additional users may have a role enabled to their account that provides "User Administrator"
      privilege. Regardless of the authentication mode, AP Analyzer manages a user's authorizations
      via roles and groups.</p>
