   <conbody>
      <p>SenSage AP manages security through authentication and authorization of security processes,
      providing two main verification checks, one that authenticates both users and groups and the
      other that determines the functions they are authorized to perform. SenSage AP Account
      Administrators manage these security processes through the SenSage AP Analyzer, which provides
      a dashboard of account and security management tasks.</p>
      <p>Each area of Security Management is briefly described below.</p>
