   <title>Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Your SenSage AP Deployment</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>This procedure stops, starts, or restarts the EDW and the other SenSage AP components on the
      host from which you are running Deployment Manager.</p>
      <p>
         <note>Deployment Manager manages specific SenSage AP files, which means any edits to these
        managed files are overwritten (usually when the service is started through Deployment
        Manager). For a list of files managed by Deployment Manager, see Appendix D.</note> To start
      and stop your entire SenSage AP deployment:</p>
      <ol id="ol_r5w_qrh_vx">
         <li>Log into Deployment Manager.</li>
         <li>. From the Deployment Manager Dashboard, select the Services tab.</li>
         <li>Above the Alerts and Health Checks, start or stop the entire deployment by selecting the
          <uicontrol>Start</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Stop</uicontrol> button.<note>If the Deployment
          Manager is running, you will see both the Restart button (green top and bottom curved
          lines) with the red circular Stop button; however, if any components in the deployment are
          stopped, you will see the triangular Start button instead of the red circular Stop
          button.</note>
