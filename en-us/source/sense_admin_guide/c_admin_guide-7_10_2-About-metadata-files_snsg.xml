   <title>About metadata files</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Each gathered log file is paired with an XML-based metadata file of the same name. The
      metadata file contains information about the source of the log data and its current status.
      The metadata file is created when the log file is fully transferred into the Collector (that
      is, when the <filepath>.pmd</filepath> file is created). The extension of a log file changes
      as it moves through the system, but its corresponding metadata file keep its
        <filepath>.meta</filepath> extension throughout.</p>
      <p>For more information about log file names and extensions, see <xref href="c_admin_guide-7_8-Description-of-Log-F_snsg.xml#topic_7_8"/>.</p>
