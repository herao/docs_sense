   <title id="title_a43">Archiving of Local Data to Nearline Storage</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>You can archive the local data in a table to Nearline storage with the
        <codeph>archivetbl</codeph> subcommand of the <codeph>atmanage</codeph> utility. You can
      archive the entire table, or you can limit the archiving to a specific time frame. You will
      need to run this command every time you want to archive data. You may want to write a script
      that calculates the maximum and minimum timestamp parameters required by the command, and then
      schedule that script to run on a regular schedule using a scheduling utility such as the Linux
        <codeph>cron</codeph> utility.</p>
