   <title>Roles and Permissions in the Analyzer Database</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>All information for authorizing access to functionality or data in the application is stored
      in the Analyzer database. Therefore, in order for a user in LDAP to be able to use the
      Analyzer application, the user must be created in the Analyzer database and given appropriate
      permissions. When an administrator creates a new user and LDAP authentication is in use, the
      administrator must pick from a list of users that are present in LDAP.</p>
      <note>In AP Analyzer, you can add or modify a user's first, last name, or email address and
      synchronize this information with LDAP. For details, see the <cite>SenSage AP Analyzer
        Guide</cite>.</note>
