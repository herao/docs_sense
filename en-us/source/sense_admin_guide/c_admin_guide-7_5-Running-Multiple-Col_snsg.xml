   <title id="title_a28">Running Multiple Collectors</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>If a situation requires that you set up multiple Collectors (on different hosts), they should
      be configured to each manage a subset of log queues, and the subsets should not overlap. You
      can achieve this setup by using a daisy-chain configuration. For more information, see
        <i>Creating Daisy Chains</i> in “SenSage AP Collector Configuration” of the <cite>Collector
        Guide</cite>.</p>
