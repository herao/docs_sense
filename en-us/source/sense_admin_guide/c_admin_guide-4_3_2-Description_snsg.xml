   <title>Description</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>The <codeph>atmanage</codeph> utility enables management of various aspects of the EDW,
      including managing users, roles, and permissions; creating, deleting, and renaming tables; and
      stopping tasks.</p>
      <p>Because atmanage requests may alter the state of the EDW, use this utility carefully. To
      examine the current state of the EDW, use the <codeph>atview</codeph> command.</p>
