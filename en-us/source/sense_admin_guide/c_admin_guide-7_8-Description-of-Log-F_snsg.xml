   <title>Description of Log File Names</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Source log files are renamed to have a zero-padded, 3-digit priority number at the beginning
      of the filename. Non-prioritized files are marked with <codeph>000</codeph>. To prioritize a
      log, change the number to 1 higher than the highest number in the log queue. Loaders will look
      for the file with the highest number when considering which file to load.</p>
      <p>Log files also have an ISO timestamp added to their name showing the time at which they were
      gathered, a sequence ID in the event that two logs are gathered during the same timestamp, and
      a string identifying the retriever that retrieved them.</p>
      <p>The configuration file <filepath>config.xml</filepath> defines the log-queue directories
      where log files are stored. For more information, see <i>Configuring Log Queues</i> in
      “SenSage AP Collector Configuration” of the <cite>Collector Guide</cite>.</p>
