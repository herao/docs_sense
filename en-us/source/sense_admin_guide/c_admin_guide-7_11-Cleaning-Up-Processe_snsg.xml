   <title id="title_a31">Cleaning Up Processed Log Files</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>Once a log file has been processed, it is put into the <codeph>&lt;LogQueue&gt;/done</codeph>
      subdirectory. The system administrator must archive or remove these files from the system.
      SenSage AP software includes a cleaner script with the Collector as an example of the type of
      script you should write to schedule the automatic deletion of processed log files. Run the
      script or program from the command line, and specify the path to your LogRoot as an
      option.</p>
      <p>On Linux, run this script:</p>
      <codeblock xml:space="preserve">/opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/bin/collector-extras/cleaner.pl</codeblock>
      <p>To learn more about LogRoot, see <i>Root Directories Used by the SenSage AP Collector</i> in
      “SenSage AP Collector Configuration” of the<cite> Collector Guide</cite>.</p>
