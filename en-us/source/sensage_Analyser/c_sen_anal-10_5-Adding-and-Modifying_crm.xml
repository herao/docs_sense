  <title>Adding and Modifying Groups</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>Groups are a way to define task actions limited to an organizational level. By defining a
      group, you control what data a group can view and what actions the group can perform on an
      object. In the case of synchronizing groups with one or more AD servers, you need to specify
      the AD server and the associated group DN so that the users within the group DN are
      synchronized with the group available in Analyzer.</p>
