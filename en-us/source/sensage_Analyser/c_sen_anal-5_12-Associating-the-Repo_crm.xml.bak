   <title>Associating the Report with a Related Report for Drill-down</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>Associated reports are two reports that are related by one more columns that each have the
      same meaning in the two different reports. The association enables users to quickly drill down
      from the source report to a target report automatically filtered to the specific set of rows
      that the user selects in the source report.</p>
    <p>The report you are currently working on will be the source report. You need to specify the
      target report and which field(s) in the source report relate to which field(s) in the target
      report. You may have any number of target reports.</p>
