   <title>Zooming into a Report Timeframe</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>By “painting” a section on the chart, one can easily zoom in on that timeframe. Both the
      chart and the grid will be updated with the new timeframe. To paint a section of the chart,
      click and drag the pointer across the section of the chart you want to select. For example,
      selecting the chart from <uicontrol>2016Feb</uicontrol> to the
      <uicontrol>2016May</uicontrol>(shown by the double arrow), results in the new new chart
      display as shown in figure below.</p>
