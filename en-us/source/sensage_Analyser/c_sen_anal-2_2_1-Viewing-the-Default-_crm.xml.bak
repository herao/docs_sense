   <title>Viewing the Default Dashboard</title>
   <conbody>
      <p>At login, the dashboard that is displayed is unlocked so that the pods are situated based
         on the screen size of your device. The name of the dashboard is displayed at the top
         left-corner of the screen.</p>
      <p>If you want to resize your browser, but keep the pods in place, click the "Lock" button
         (magnet icon). Your browser will then add scroll bars to resize without affecting the pods
         positioning.</p>
      <p>To maximize a pod for full screen viewing, click the option in the podâ€™s title bar. Click
            <b>Escape</b> to exit full screen view and return to dashboard view.</p>
      <section><title>Switching Between Dashboards</title>
         <p>Click the <b>Dashboard</b> menu to display a dropdown list of all dashboards in the
            system that you are allowed to access. Clicking a different dashboard name will access
            that dashboard on the screen.</p>
