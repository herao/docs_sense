    <ol id="ol_og1_bvq_zx">
      <li>To edit the chart from the report results view (if desired, after running the report):
        <ol
          id="ol_vhv_dvq_zx">
          <li>Go to the Analyzer dashboard, select Data Design from the dropdown list and click
              Reports.<p>The Manage Report screen with the current listing of reports is
              displayed.</p></li>
          <li>Scroll or find the desired report, check the report, and click Run. (if desired) or
            click Edit. </li>
          <li>From the view results screen for the report, click the Gear icon, and choose Edit a
            Chart from the dropdown list.</li>
        <li>Go to Step 3.</li>
        </ol></li>
      <li>To edit an existing chart from the Edit Report definition screen:<ol><li>Go to the Analyzer dashboard, select Data Design from the dropdown list and click Reports.<p>The
              Manage Report screen with the current listing of reports is displayed.</p></li><li>Scroll or find the desired report, check the report, and click Edit. Go to Step 3.</li></ol></li>
      <li>Click the Charting tab.<note>NOTE: If a red triangle is displayed next to the Charting tab
          as shown in Figure 5-5, this indicates the chart has not been completely configured or has
          an error in the configuration. As long as the chart is not configured completely and
          correctly, you will be unable to save the chart. When working within the Edit Report
          Definition screen, you can switch to alternate tabs; however, the red triangle indicates
          why you cannot save the report, since the chart is not configured
          correctly.</note><p>Figure 5-5: Chart Settings Screen</p><p><image
