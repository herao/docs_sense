   <title>Moving and Re-organizing Pods</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>When a dashboard first loads in each user-session, it remains unlocked; this allows the pods
      to arrange themselves on the screen based on the screen size of the device in use. If you want
      to keep the pods the way they are currently displayed, click the "lock" button (magnet icon);
      this will also allow the browser to add a scroll bar when resized.</p>

    <p>Now you can manually re-organize the pods by dragging them with the mouse.</p>
    <p>You can resize any of the pods by holding the mouse over the edge of the pod you want to move
      and using the mouse to slide the edge larger or smaller. For example:</p>
    <fig><title>Resizing Pods</title><image href="./media/Image_031.png" placement="break" id="image_a2n_ptl_zx" scale="110"/></fig>
    <p>If you have edit rights on the dashboard you can save the layout by clicking the gear icon
      and then Save Layout.</p>
    <p>For more information on viewing options, refer to Chapter 2: Viewing Reports, Charts, and
      Models.</p>
