   <title id="title_a12">What is a Data Model?</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>A data model is a blueprint for manipulating data with multiple different steps. Each step
      performs an independent operation on the data, not just a single query against a database
      returning a single result set. The data may originate from an EDW query; however, it may also
      originate from a file, from an LDAP directory, from PostgreSQL or other database sources, or
      from user input. The model is created in a standard HTML web browser and is executed on the
      Analyzer’s server within a SenSage AP deployment.</p>
    <p>In Analyzer, models may be created, saved, reused, or even scheduled to execute periodically.
      A primary goal of SenSage AP’s modeling capability is to avoid the need for exporting data
      from the Event Data Warehouse (EDW) and manipulating data by scripts or with third-party tools
      such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
