   <title id="title_a9">Setting Up the Initial Analyzer Dashboard</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>If you have Analyzer "Administrator" privileges and you are setting up Analyzer for the first
      time, you will need to create an initial dashboard. After logging into Analyzer, you will be
      prompted to "Create a Dashboard" through a large icon in the center of the page as shown in
      Figure 3-1 below. Click this icon.</p>

    <p>A dashboard settings box is displayed to define your new dashboard. Figure 3-2 Dashboard
      Settings</p>
    <p>To set your dashboard:</p>
    <ol id="ol_pld_lhm_zx">
      <li>Provide a name for the dashboard. Note that if you leave the name field blank, you will
        not be able to save the dashboard.</li>
      <li>If desired (optional), select to have your dashboard automatically refresh on a periodic
        basis. This is appropriate if you have low-impact reports (over short timeframes) that are
        scheduled to run on a regular basis.<p>
          <note>If this option is selected, then whenever a user has the dashboard displayed
            in a browser, all reports on the dashboard will run at the specified interval.</note>
        </p></li>
      <li>If desired (optional), to set the dashboard to automatically refresh, click the checkbox
        to the left of "Auto-refresh every" and provide an integer for the number of minutes between refreshes.<p>
          <note>It is recommended to set this lower than every 60 minutes.</note>
        </p></li>
      <li>To save the dashboard, click <uicontrol>Save Dashboard</uicontrol>.</li>
      <li>To add reports to the dashboard, see <xref
          href="c_sen_anal-4_4-Adding-Reports-to-a-_crm.xml"/>.</li>
    </ol>
