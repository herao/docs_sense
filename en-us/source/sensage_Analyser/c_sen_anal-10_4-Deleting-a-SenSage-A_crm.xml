   <title>Deleting a SenSage AP User</title>
   <conbody>
    <note>
      <p>IMPORTANT: To first delete a SenSage AP user that is also in Active Directory, be sure to
        remove the user account in Active Directory first before removing the account in Analyzer.
        The AD synchronization will not delete any user in Analyzer. If you delete a user only in
        Analyzer without first deleting the user in AD, the user will re-appear whenever LDAP/AD
        synchronization is executed.</p>
    </note>
    <p>To delete a SenSage AP user:</p>
    <ol id="ol_vkb_cfs_zx">

        Manage Users screen is displayed.</li>
