   <title id="title_a17">Sharing Models</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>By default, a model is only accessible to the user who created it. When a user initially
      creates a model, they are only able to view it. To allow others to view the model, the user
      who created the model must "share" it.</p>
    <p>
      <draft-comment author="Hemraj">DOES THIS RULE ALSO APPLY TO COMPONENTS?</draft-comment>
    </p>
    <p>Models are shared through the following methods:</p>
    <ul id="ul_bjg_fvr_zx">
      <li>
        <p>Using the Shared button on the Model Listing or the Models Menu bar</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>Using the Models Export or Import option. For details see</p>
        
      </li>
    </ul>
