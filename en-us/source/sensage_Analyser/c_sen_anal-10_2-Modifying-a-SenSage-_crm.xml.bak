   <title id="title_a22">Modifying a SenSage AP User</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>If you have Analyzer Administration (Admin) privileges, you can modify SenSage AP user
      information, reset SenSage AP passwords, and reassign roles and groups.</p>
    <p>
      <note>NOTE: When you make modifications to users in Analyzer, you also change the settings or
        users in Active Directory (AD). However, these changes will be over-written with settings
        from Active Directory whenever the user database is synchronized with AD. The AD
        synchronization updates all fields for all users. The only exception is if you have a SAM
        (Security Account Manager) account and noy corresponding SAM account is found in Active
        Directory. For details on SAM, see <cite>SenSage AP Administration Guide</cite>.</note>
    </p>
    <note>
      <p>IMPORTANT: If you are deleting a user who is the owner of a specific report, schedule, or
        dashboard, these objects will continue to remain in the system. However, the ability to
        view, edit, run, and delete objects will be transferred automatically to the Admin user. To
        prevent this, the owner must transfer ownership of the report, schedule, or dashboard,
        before they are deleted. Only the owner, not the Administrator, is able to transfer
        ownership. The recovery process for the owner to use if the object is already deleted is to
        change ownership with SQL. For example:</p>
      <codeblock>sql to set the object owner to 'bob' for report with id
100150 update acl_object_identity set owner_sid = (select id from acl_sid where
sid = 'bob') where object_id_identity = 100150</codeblock>
      <p>To find the report id and the object_id identity value (100150 in the example above), enter
        the following commands:</p>
      <codeblock>t1.object_id_identity=t2.id and name='&lt;&lt;REPORT_NAME>>';</codeblock>
    </note>
