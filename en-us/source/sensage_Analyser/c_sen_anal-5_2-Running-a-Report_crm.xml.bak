    <p>To run a report:</p>
    <ol id="ol_n31_hpm_zx">
      <li>Go to the Analyzer dashboard, select Data Design from the dropdown list and click Reports.
        The Manage Report screen with the current listing of reports is displayed.</li>
      <li>First scroll or use filters to find the desired report. For details on finding reports,
        see Chapter 2: Viewing Reports. Then select the report:<p>a If you want to view a report’s
          last run, check the desired report, click the Run button, and from the dropdown list,
          select View Last Run. Otherwise, see Step 3.</p><note>NOTE: The View Last Run option will
          access which ever is the latest report from the report’s history; the last report run can
          be either an ad hoc or scheduled report.</note><p>NEED NEW SCREENSHOT</p><p>Figure 4-10:

      <li>If selecting a report to run instead of viewing a last run of a report, choose one of the
        desired Run options described below:
        <p>
          <note>You may check only one report to run at one time; however, you can select other
            reports without waiting for the previous report to complete. If you have logged out of a
            session in which reports are running, they will continue to run, but will not be available
            for viewing in the Report Queue.</note>

        <ol><li>To run the report and retain a copy of the report for historical purposes, select Run and
          Retain. The report’s run history is retained up to a specified retention period that is set
          for the report (see “Setting Report Retention for Report History”, on page 74).</li>
        <li>To run the report once and save it only for the duration of the session, select Run Once.
          After you end your session and log out, the report no longer exists in the system and no
          history of the run is recorded.
