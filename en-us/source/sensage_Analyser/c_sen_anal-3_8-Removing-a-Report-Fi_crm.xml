   <title>Removing a Report Filter</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>You can find the reports you need by using the filters available at the top of each column.
      In the screenshot below, the reports are filtered by the <uicontrol>Owner</uicontrol> column,
      to get the list of all reports owned by the <uicontrol>admin</uicontrol>. To remove the filter
      condition, click the <uicontrol>x</uicontrol> to the right of the filter label (circled in red
      in the figure below).</p>
