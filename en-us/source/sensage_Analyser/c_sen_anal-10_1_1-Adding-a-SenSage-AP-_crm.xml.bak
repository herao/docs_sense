   <title>Adding a SenSage AP User in a Single/Multiple-AD Server Environment</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>This section describes how to manually create a user using Analyzer and how to map that user
      to a single LDAP/AD server or to multiple LDAP/AD servers.</p>
    <p>To add a SenSage AP user</p>
    
    <ol id="ol_mrk_hds_zx">
      <li>Go to Analyzer, select Administration --> Users from the dropdown submenu. The Manage
        Users screen is displayed as shown in Figure 9-1.<p>Figure 9-1: Manage Users
            Screen</p><p><image href="./media/Image_385.jpg" height="254" width="509"
            id="image_lrk_hds_zx"/></p></li>
      <li>To add a user, click the <b>Add a User </b>button as shown in Figure 9-2 below:<p>Figure
          9-2: Add a User Button</p><p>
          <image href="./media/Image_386.jpg" height="320" width="589" id="image_nrk_hds_zx"
            placement="break"/>
        </p><p>The pop-up window for adding a user displays. </p><p>Figure 9-3: Account Settings for
          Adding a New User</p><p>
          <image href="./media/Image_387.jpg" height="353" width="385" id="image_ork_hds_zx"
            placement="break"/>
        </p></li>
      <li>In the popup window, enter the Username for the SenSage AP user, the user’s email, the
        name of the user, the Postgres User.</li>
      <li>Specify the LDAP/DN details for the user.</li>
      <li>From the AD/LDAP Location dropdown list, select the AD server for this user.<p>
          <note>NOTE: The dropdown list contains AD servers which were configured in Deployment
            Manager along with AD servers which are listed in the ldap.properties file.</note>
        </p></li>
      <li>In the lower part of the popup window, check the boxes next to the roles and groups you
        want to assign to this user.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Save </b>when you are finished.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Once the user is added, see “Synchronizing Users from Active Directory/LDAP”,
        on page 162 to update the user in Analyzer.</li>
      <li>Select a Postgres account which will be used to map this user. Note that this step is
        critical as the initial setup of the Analyzer admin account is not useable with this
        mapping. DO NOT select "sls" or "controller" accounts as these are reserved accounts. <p>If
          you need to create additional choices in Postgres, create the additional role using the
          following PSQL
        commands:</p><codeblock>CREATE ROLE &lt;&lt;ROLE_NAME>> NOSUPERUSER CREATEDB NOCREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN
PASSWORD '&lt;&lt;PASSWORD>>';
ALTER USER &lt;&lt;ROLE_NAME>> SET SEARCH_PATH = siem,saved_result,public';</codeblock>
      </li>
    </ol>
