   <title>Providing Multiple Input Connections</title>
   <conbody>
     <p>When making a multiple input connections:</p>
      
        <ul id="ul_yhy_3tr_zx">
          
            
          
          <li> From the output of each source component, click the "result" icon and then click the
        "input" icon on the target component that will be connected to a source component (see
        Figure 6-18). <draft-comment author="Hemraj">NEED TO USE THIS HANDS-ON TO VERIFY HOW IT
          WORKS </draft-comment><p>There are no limits to the number of connections you can define
          to a target component.</p><p>
          <note>When an input target component has more than one source component as its
            input, a "blue" brick appears in the input icon on the target component.</note>
        </p><p>ï‚Ÿ Click the "blue" brick on a target component to view all of its inputs, which will
          appear in numbered boxes in the order in which each parameter input was set to the target
          component.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>After connectors are established, you can redirect them to another component input.
