   <title>Deleting Groups</title>
   <conbody>
    <note>NOTE: When performing a group deletion, the group is deleted only in the Analyzer, not in
      Active Directory. Once the group is deleted from Analyzer, it is no longer possible to
      synchronize the group from Active Directory.</note>
    <p>To delete a SenSage AP group:</p>
    <ol id="ol_arx_13s_zx">
      <li>Go to the Analyzer, select <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Administration</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Groups</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> from the dropdown submenu and click Groups from the drop-down submenu.</li>
      <li>Select the group for deletion in the Select a Group dropdown and click the trash icon as
        shown in Figure 9-9 below. Note that if the group has existing members you will not be able
        to delete it and will get an error message.<p>Figure 9-9: Deleting a Group</p><p><image
