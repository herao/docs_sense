      these three pieces of information, which are required to log into Analyzer.</p>

    <p>After your timezone has been saved, this change now applies to all time zones displayed
      throughout the SenSage AP UI.</p>
    <p>After you have logged into Analyzer (and if logging in the first time specified your
      timezone), the default Dashboard is displayed as shown below. The contents of this screen are
      customizable.</p>
