   <title>Adding and Modifying Roles</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>Roles are a way to define task actions limited to a job responsibility. Roles have a list of
      privileges that dictate what actions a user may perform. See Appendix B: SenSage AP Permission
      Requirements which lists supported permissions required to perform actions for specific
      SenSage AP applications such as scheduling, reporting, etc. Together with groups, roles
      control what services a user may view and what actions users and groups can perform on
      services and their objects. For conceptual details on defining roles, refer to the
      Administrative Guide.</p>
    <p>To add/modify a SenSage AP AP role:</p>
