   <title>APPENDIX C: SETTING UP ANALYZER FOR CUSTOM CHARTS</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>This appendix contains instructions for setting up Analyzer to accept Custom Charts for
      reports that you have created using the Add a Chart feature. For details on adding the actual
      chart to the interface, see <xref href="c_sen_anal-6_7-Creating-or-Modifyin_crm.xml"
        />.<draft-comment author="Hemraj"> - NEED INFO and SCREENSHOTS</draft-comment></p>
    <p>The Add a Chart feature contains a tab to create custom reports. In order for this feature to
      work you must be sure that you have configured your system to handle custom reports. To do
      this, perform the following steps:</p>
    <note>
      <p>IMPORTANT: You may need to consult with your System Administrator to set up custom
        reports.</p>

      <li>In Tomcat, modify the context.xml file in the tomcat conf directory to accept aliases.
        Include the context attribute of context.xml as shown in the configuration example
          below:<p>&lt;Context reloadable="true" aliases=" /custom=/opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/analyzer/
          custom">;</p></li>
      <li>Restart Tomcat for the change to take effect.</li>
      <li>Open the service directory folder at: /opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/analyzer.</li>
      <li>Within that folder, create the custom folder so the path now is: /opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/
        analyzer/custom.</li>
      <li>Place the following in the custom folder:<p>a &lt;body> section of the custom HTML page b
          supporting Java script and css files</p><p>c optionally, a custom chart page that includes
          &lt;HAWKEYE_AP_ANALYZER_REPORT_RESULTS/></p><p>to get the report results</p><p>NOTE:
          Results of the executed report will be used to generate the chart.</p></li>
      <li>After you create a report, from the Add a Chart dialog, select Custom Chart and be sure to
        enter the same HTML file name that is included in the /opt/hexis/hawkeye-ap/analyzer/ custom
        folder.</li>
      <li>When entering the name of the HTML file in the dialog box, be sure to prefix the HTML file
        name with /analyzer/custom.</li>
    </ol>
     <note>NOTE: For details on using the interface to request the chart, see <xref
