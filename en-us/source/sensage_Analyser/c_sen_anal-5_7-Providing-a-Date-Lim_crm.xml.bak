   <title>Providing a Date Limit Prompt in the Report</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>In the report, you can specify that users be prompted for a date range that the report will
      include or specify a date and time range limit for the reporting results.</p>
    <p>To provide a date limit prompt in the report:</p>
    <ol id="ol_mxg_v2q_zx">
      <li>Click the Date Limits tab in the Report Wizard to specify your date limit
          settings.<draft-comment author="Hemraj">NEED NEW SCREENSHOT</draft-comment><p>Figure 4-27:

            id="image_nxg_v2q_zx"/></p></li>
      <li>Check the first box on the screen to specify that the system prompt the person running a
        report too change the time range.<p>
          <note>A date/time popup will be displayed and populated with the time range used
            previously, but allow the person running the report to change the value if
            desired.</note>
        </p></li>
      <li>Specify a time range for a report (if working with EDW tables and OAE During); otherwise,
        if working with Postgres tables, the feature is disabled as the system will automatically
        provide the time range by working only with the timestamp.<note>NOTE: When you specify a time
          range or configure the time zone within your user profile, your own local timezone (the
          location of the client) in GMT format is assumed as the timezone of that
        selection.</note></li>
      <li>When you are finished, click <b>Save </b>or choose one of the following Save Options: Save
        and close, Save run and retain (for report history), or Save and run once (no history).</li>
    </ol>
