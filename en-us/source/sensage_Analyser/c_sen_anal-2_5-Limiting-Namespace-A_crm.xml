                <p>When administering SenSage AP user roles and privileges in the Analyzer, you can
                  limit a user's access to a namespace. The following is an overview of this
                  procedure:</p>
                <ol id="ol_rvn_lwl_zx">
                  <li>
                    Create a Postgres user/role.
                  </li>
                  <li> Grant access to the schema/namespace.
        <codeblock>grant schema usage 
grant select privilege</codeblock></li>
                  <li>
                    Update the Analyzer Application user's postgres user setting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Log on as the user that you edited in Step 3 and verify schema access.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              
            
          
        
      
    
    <p>The easiest way to do this is to create a report and see what schemas are available or run
      reports that access a schema that the user has and/or does not have permission to access.</p>
     <note>The steps are different for a SenSage AP 6.x.x system and a 5.0.0 system. On a 5.0.0
      system, after completing the procedure, you must grant users Select privilege to provide them
      with access to the tables. Refer to <xref href="c_sen_anal-13-APPENDIXA-NAMESPAC_crm.xml"
      />(steps for 6.x.x or 5.0.0) for specific instructions.</note>
