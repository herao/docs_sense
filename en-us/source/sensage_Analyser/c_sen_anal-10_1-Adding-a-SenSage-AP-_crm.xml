   <title id="title_a21">Adding a SenSage AP Users</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>If you have Analyzer Administration privileges, you can add SenSage AP users and assign roles
      and groups for each user according to their level of responsibility. Note that roles determine
      what functionality a user will have in the SenSage AP application; roles are assigned to one
      or more users in an organization.</p>
    <p>
      <note>For details on roles and types of permissions associated with each in the SenSage AP
        system, see <xref href="c_sen_anal-14-APPENDIXB-SENSAGE_crm.xml"/>.</note>
    </p>
    <p>
      <note>Initially, when installing SenSage AP Analyzer, an Analyzer admin account is set
        up which provides the privilege to create SenSage AP user accounts with appropriate group
        and role permissions that match the user name of an LDAP or AD/LDAP user.</note>
    </p>
    <p>Before you proceed with managing SenSage AP users in a single or multi-realm environment,
      make sure that you have already configured your environment for AD/LDAP integration. For
      information on how to configure AD/LDAP integration, the see the <cite>SenSage AP
        Administration Guide</cite>.</p>
