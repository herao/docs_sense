   <title>Analytics Workbench</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>The Analytics Workbench is a tool in the SenSage AP Analyzer that allows users to execute
      advanced analytics data processing on the log event data stored in the Event Data Warehouse or
      other databases. In Analyzer, a set of analytics processing components put together in the
      Analytics Workbench is known as a data model. The Analytics workbench has a drag and drop
      graphical programming functionality to provide advanced analytic processing capability.</p>
    <p>Models created in the Analytics workbench can be simple as shown in Figure 6-1 with a few
      components as an input to another component.</p>

    <p>The Analytics workbench is also capable of creating arbitrarily complex model as shown in
      Figure 6-2. Models can be saved as components to be nested (re-used) in other models with
      unlimited levels of nesting.</p>
