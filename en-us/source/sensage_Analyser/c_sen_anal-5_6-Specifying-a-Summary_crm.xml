   <title>Specifying a Summary Report</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>A summary (also known as an aggregation report) displays an aggregated count of fields in the
      report.</p>
    <p>To specify the report as a summary report:</p>
     <ol id="ol_dml_12q_zx">     
    <li>In the Report Wizard, click the checkbox next to the label "This is a summary report" in the
        upper right corner.<p>Two additional columns are displayed with the following headings:
          "Group By" and "Display Value. By default, each column displays an aggregation function,
          "Count" for string fields and "Sum" for number fields.</p><p>
          <note>At this point the report is not yet ready to run as at least one field to
            "group by" is required that will drive the aggregation functions</note>
        </p><p>Figure 4-23: Specifying Summary Report</p><p><image href="./media/Image_172.png" placement="break" scale="50"/></p></li>
    <li>To select fields to "group by" click the checkbox in the row(s) that represent the field(s)
        that you want to drive the aggregation.<p>Each time you check the Group By box that row will
          be duplicated and the value in the Display Value column of the original row will change to
          "Field Value". These are the only columns which will show actual data from the source
          table. The remaining columns show the aggregate function (summary information) of the
          source raw data in that field.</p><p>Figure 4-24: Specifying Fields to Group By for Report

      <li>To change the type of aggregate function, click the dropdown arrow to see the options in
        the Display Value column. The options are different for each datatype.<p>Figure 4-25:

      <li>If you are grouping by more than one field, the order in which the aggregation is
        calculated may impact the results. To change the order of aggregation, hover the mouse over
        the number in the Group By column. When two arrows are displayed, click the up or down arrow
        to increase or decrease the order of that field.<p>
          <note>By default, a sort order is added along with the aggregation order. You can
            change both the sort and aggregation orders. Refer to the Step 10 on page 61 in Creating
            a Report and to the aggregation ordering instructions in Steps 3 and 4 above of these
            instructions.</note>

      <li>When you are finished, click <b>Save </b>or choose one of the following Save Options: Save
        and close, Save run and retain (for report history), or Save and run once (no history).</li>
