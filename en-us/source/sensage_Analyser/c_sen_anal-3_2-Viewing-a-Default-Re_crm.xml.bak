   <title>Viewing a Default Report Display</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>The screen below shows a default display of a typical report. The top of the report displays
      the report name and the timeframe in which the report was run. Some reports are configured
      with charts that use a specific chart type as shown in the example.</p>
    <p>For details on how to create charts with reports, see <xref
        href="c_sen_anal-6-CREATING-ANDMODIFYI_crm.xml"/>.</p>
    <p>Note also that you can click on a column label of a report which will sort the report by that
      column. Clicking on the same column again sorts the report in the alternative direction. In
      the following screenshot the <uicontrol>ts</uicontrol> (time stamp) column is sorted in the
      descending order.</p>
