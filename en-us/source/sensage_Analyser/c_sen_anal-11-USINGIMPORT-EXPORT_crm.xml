   <title>Using Import, Export, and Download Features</title>
   <conbody>
    
      
        <p>This chapter describes how to use SenSage AP Analyzer to import and export its data
          objects such as reports, charts, and dashboards.</p>
        <p>This chapter contains the following topics:</p>
        <ul id="ul_tvy_bjs_zx">
          <li>
            <p>Importing/Exporting Reports</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Importing/Exporting Dashboards</p>
            <p>
          <note>IMPORTANT: There is no way to import/export both reports and dashboards at the same
            time in one file. You can manually do this by editing an XML file. When you export the
            dashboard any underlying reports are also exported.</note>
