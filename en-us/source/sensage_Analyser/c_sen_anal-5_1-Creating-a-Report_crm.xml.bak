   <title id="title_a10">Creating a Report</title>
   <conbody>
    <p>To create a report in Analyzer, perform the following tasks:</p>
    <ol id="ol_l4f_bmm_zx">
      <li>Go to the Analyzer dashboard, select Data Design from the dropdown list, click Reports,
        and click the Create a Report button.<p>NEED NEW SCREENSHOT</p><p>Figure 4-1: Create a
          Report Button</p><p><image href="./media/Image_136.jpg" height="312" width="578"
            id="image_m4f_bmm_zx"/></p><p>The first screen that is displayed lets you select the
          schema in which your data resides.</p></li>
      <li>Click the triangle to the left of the schema that you want to use as shown in the three
        sample screens below.<p>
          <note>NOTE: Each schema is either a schema local to the PostgreSQL database or represents
            a Namespace in the Event Data Warehouse. Namespaces can be hierarchical only in the EDW,
            so when viewed in PostgreSQL the docs (“.”) are replaced with underscores (“_”).</note>
        </p><p>Figure 4-2: Select Columns to Add to a Report</p><p><image
            href="./media/Image_137.jpg" height="182" width="479" id="image_n4f_bmm_zx"/></p><p>As
          shown in Figure 4-3 and Figure 4-4, in a typical default deployment with a default EDW
          instance name, the Schema “default_analytics” contains tables with the raw data collected
          from all sources in your environment, and “default_analytics_intellischema” contains
          event-based normalized views of the same data.</p><p>Figure 4-3: default_analytics
          Tables</p><p><image href="./media/Image_138.jpg" height="204" width="507"
            id="image_o4f_bmm_zx"/></p><p>Figure 4-4:default_analytics_intellischema
            Views</p><p><image href="./media/Image_139.jpg" height="219" width="516"
            id="image_p4f_bmm_zx"/></p><p>Also the Schema “default_sensage_systemanalytics” contains
          raw data collected from the SenSage AP installation itself, and the Schema
          “default_sensage_systemanalytics_intellischema” contains event-based normalized views of
          that data.</p><p>Schemas ending with the name “ .. .<u>c</u>onnectors” are not normally
          used for reporting however they may be helpful in debugging IntelliSchema views.</p></li>
      <li>From the column dropdown list, click a raw data table or normalized view such as the view
        userlogin below to see the columns in the table.<p>Figure 4-5: userlogin View</p><p><image
            href="./media/Image_140.jpg" height="244" width="574" id="image_q4f_bmm_zx"/></p></li>
      <li>Click each column that you want to use in your report. As you click, the column is
        immediately moved to the right-side pane.<p>
          <note>NOTE: Keep in mind few columns will have better performance due to the nature of
            columnar databases with true column-based storage systems.</note>
        </p></li>
      <li>Click the Select button to complete selection of your columns.</li>
      <li>Click a raw data table or normalized view such as the view "userlogin" above to see the
        columns in that table.</li>
      <li>Click each column you want to use in your report. As you click, the columns you select
        will immediately move to the right pane.<p>
          <note>TIP: Due to the nature of columnar databases with true column-based storage system,
            limit the number of columns for better performance.</note>
        </p><p><image href="./media/Image_141.jpg" height="210" width="545" id="image_r4f_bmm_zx"
          /></p></li>
      <li>Click Select when you have completed selecting your columns.<p>The next screen that is
          displayed allows you to configure your report.</p><p>
          <note>NOTE: In the Report Fields screen, the grid has a row that represents each column in
            the report. The datatype is represented by the second column in the grid and may be
            string, number, or datetime. Also note that as you set up your report fields, you can
            save your report with one of the following Save options: Save and close, Save run and
            retain (for report history), or Save and run once (no history), letting you view the
            report as you create it.</note>

      <li>If desired, provide a more user-friendly name for the heading of any field in the final
        report. To do this, double-click the name in the "Report Column Header" column.<p>Figure
          4-7: Report Column Header Column</p><p><image href="./media/Image_143.jpg" height="217"
            width="554" id="image_t4f_bmm_zx"/></p></li>
      <li>If desired, change the sort order of the report. All the options for sorting are on the
        right of the grid under the "Sort By" heading.<ol id="ol_rbl_mmm_zx">
          <li>Click the checkbox of the row(s) representing the column(s) you want to sort by.</li>
          <li>If you want to sort by more than one column you can change which column is the primary
            sort condition and which is the secondary sort condition. Click the up or down arrow to
            increase or decrease the sort order of that field.By default sorting is in ascending
            order. To change it to descending order, click the arrows to the far right. <p>Figure
              4-8: Sorting by Column</p><p><image href="./media/Image_144.jpg" height="189"
                width="500" id="image_u4f_bmm_zx"/></p></li>
        </ol></li>
      <li>To change the order that columns will appear in the report (left to right), re-order the
        columns (top to bottom). To do this, drag the rows up and down with the "handles" in the
        second column.<p>Figure 4-9: Reordering Column Order</p><p><image
